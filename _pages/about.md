Hello there! My name is Mithilesh Vaidya.

I’m a final year dual-degree student in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Bombay. I plan to use this website as a medium for sharing my projects and other random thoughts.

I was part of Autonise AI, a small group of machine learning enthusiasts during my sophomore year.
We worked on 2 projects:
* Semantic Segmentation
* Text Detection and Recognition

In the summer of 2020, I interned at APT Portfolio, a high-frequency trading firm.

Currently, I am working with [Prof. Preeti Rao](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/faculty/home/prao) on processing
children's speech using deep learning techniques. I am especially interested in extracting **prosodic** features for
tasks such as **oral reading fluency assessment** and prosodic event detection such as **phrase boundary** and **word prominence**

I serve on the Editorial Board of [Insight](https://www.insightiitb.org), IIT Bombay's student media body.

In my free time, I enjoy reading [books]({{site.url}}/books) and playing [tennis]({{site.url}}/tennis).
