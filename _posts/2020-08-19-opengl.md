OpenGL was *deprecated* in macOS 10.14 which means that Apple will no longer develop newer versions of OpenGL for macOS.
However, you can still run OpenGL 4 natively on higher versions such as macOS 10.15.

Note: I am running **macOS 10.15.6** on a **2017 13-inch MacBook Pro**, which has an **Intel Iris Integrated Graphics Card**.

## Setup

1. Install Xcode. I'm not sure if this step is absolutely essential but Xcode is one of those apps which every developer should have since it also installs many essential coding libraries and frameworks.
2. Install GLEW and GLFW using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you already have Homebrew installed (it's the best package manager for Mac),
just run `brew install glfw3` and `brew install glew`

The official GLEW website states: "GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform".
In other words, it's a useful extension for developing OpenGL programs.

On the other hand, GLFW is an extension for *managing windows*. OpenGL is a bare-bones library which does not concern itself with the creation and management of windows. That job is made easy by GLFW.

## Sample Code

Let's consider a simple program which prints the *OpenGL version* and the *Integrated Graphics Card* which comes with my Mac.
The following code can be found [here](https://github.com/paragchaudhuri/cs475-tutorials/tree/master/Tutorial_00).

```c
//File: main.cpp

#include <GL/glew.h> // include GLEW and new version of GL on Windows
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h> // GLFW helper library for window management
#include <iostream> //for cout

int main (int argc, char** argv) 
{
  // start GL context and O/S window using the GLFW helper library
  if (!glfwInit ()) 
    {
      std::cerr<<"ERROR: could not start GLFW3"<<std::endl;
      return 1;
    } 

  //Setting window properties
  glfwWindowHint (GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3);
  glfwWindowHint (GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 2);
  glfwWindowHint (GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GL_TRUE);
  glfwWindowHint (GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);
  
  //Actually create the window
  GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow (640, 480, "OpenGL Initialization Example", NULL, NULL);
  if (!window) 
    {
      std::cerr<<"ERROR: could not open window with GLFW3"<<std::endl;
      glfwTerminate();
      return 1;
    }
  glfwMakeContextCurrent (window);
                                  
  // start GLEW extension handler
  glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;
  glewInit ();

  // get version info
  const GLubyte* renderer = glGetString (GL_RENDERER); // get renderer string
  const GLubyte* version = glGetString (GL_VERSION); // version as a string
  std::cout<<"Renderer: "<<renderer<<std::endl;
  std::cout<<"OpenGL version supported "<<version<<std::endl;

  // close GL context and any other GLFW resources
  glfwTerminate();
  return 0;
}
```

## Compilation

It's time to compile the program! We can use g++:

`g++ main.cpp -o test.o -lglfw -lGLEW -framework OpenGL`

Let us break this down:

* *g++* is the compiler. No surprises here.
* *main.cpp* is the file which contains the code (e.g. the above code) and is to be compiled
* *-o test.o* specifies that the output executable should be named *test.o*
* *-lglfw* and *-lGLEW* links the libraries GLFW and GLEW (which we installed via brew)
* *-framework OpenGL* is the important flag which links the actual OpenGL framework to our code

## Output

On running *test.o*, the following gets printed in the Terminal:
```
Renderer: Renderer: Intel(R) Iris(TM) Plus Graphics 650
OpenGL version supported 4.1 INTEL-14.7.8
```
