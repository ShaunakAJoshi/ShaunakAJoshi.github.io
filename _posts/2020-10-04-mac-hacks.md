## QuickLook

QuickLook is an underrated feature. By default, one can preview very limited file extensions. You can supercharge
QuickLook by installing plugins.

* Refer to [this](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/haokaiyang/Mac-QuickLook) link for an exhaustive list of plugins
* A few popular ones can be found [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins).

## Speeding up your workflow

Over the years, I have come across a few tricks/hacks for macOS which speed up my workflow. This section is a random list
of such hacks. I discovered most of them on various websites. I’ll add links to such webpages wherever necessary.

* Cutting a file/folder is one of the most basic operation when it comes to file management. Unfortunately, macOS does
not implement ⌘X to cut. Instead, you can copy using the regular ⌘C shortcut and paste using ⌥⌘V
(instead of ⌘V which simply copies the file/folder)

* Use ⌘⇧. to show hidden files/folders. The same shortcut will again hide the hidden files.

* Drag and drop a file/folder into the file selector menu to quickly navigate and choose the desired file/folder. Useful when opening/uploading files or folders.

* Ubuntu has a simple keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-Alt-T) for launching a Terminal window with the currently highlighted
directory as the working directory. One can do this on macOS by heading to:
  
  System Preferences->Keyboard->Shortcuts->Services->Files and Folders->New Terminal at Folder

  ![Terminal shortcut]({{site.url}}/assets/img/mac_tricks/terminal.png)
  
  Assign a keyboard shortcut of your choice. I currently have ⇧⌘B.
  
  The only pitfall is that you need to highlight a folder in Finder before pressing the combination. Hence, to open a
  Terminal in the current folder, hit ⌘↑ to navigate to the parent directory and then use the shortcut.
  ![Drag and Drop]({{site.url}}/assets/gifs/mac_tricks/terminal.gif)

* To get the complete file path of a file/folder, right click on the file/folder name at the bottom of the Finder
window and choose “Copy * as Pathname"

  ![Terminal shortcut]({{site.url}}/assets/img/mac_tricks/copy_path.png)

  In the above example, the following path is copied to the clipboard:
  /Users/mithileshvaidya/Desktop/tinker.py

  Note: In case the Path Bar is not visible, go to Finder -> View -> Show Path Bar

* To quickly create an empty file, follow [these](https://medium.com/@a.m./create-shortcut-for-new-txt-or-any-file-in-osx-99df9973239) instructions.
It is analogous to the ‘Create New Document’ functionality in Ubuntu, which is available with a right-click in the file explorer.

* Follow the instructions [here](https://www.macissues.com/2014/08/01/get-word-and-character-counts-for-any-selection-in-os-x/) to set up an Automator workflow which returns the word and character count for any selected text. Once the workflow is set up, one can choose text in any application, right-click, head to the *Services* section and run the script.
